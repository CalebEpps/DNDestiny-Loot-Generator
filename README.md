# DNDestiny-Loot-Generator
**Developed to be fully compatible with the DND spinoff for Destiny: DNDestiny by Velvet Fang**
*Written in Python 3.10 by Sing#6862*

### How to Use
Click "Drop an Engram" to generate a random roll. The sliders on the right control the probability of each engram. You can also toggle the different types of engrams
and seasons. A popup window will display your roll's information.

### GEAR
Gear is based on the light / medium / heavy armor found in DNDestiny. In the loot generator, warlock armor is light, hunter armor is medium,
and titan armor is heavy.

### WEAPONS
Weapons can be rolled regardless of which class type is selected. Perks are pulled randomly from the JSON file in the bin folder. You may add perks if needed.
